# Resources are Plentiful!

I wanted to build this site quickly, in time to let everyone mess around with it during some down time. 

Because of this, I am still working on the site and its content, but for now I will link all the information I have found valuable as I have learned how to use Hugo.

### Paper Mod Template Wiki

This theme has a really great [wiki](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/wiki) around it. I really suggest it if you have any questions about what this theme can do!

### Changing the Theme

Changing the theme is actually really simple, even when one theme is already established.

- The first step is finding the theme you want to work with [here](https://hugothemesfree.com/).

- The next step is to view the themes installation instructions, as they can sometimes vary.

For installation, go to the CommandShell and enter:

```
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/theme/theme.git themes/yourtheme
```

This will download the theme from GitHub as a submodule and into your theme directory.

- Once that is done, go into your config.toml and change the 'theme =' to your selected theme.

### Images

While this page does not have any images right now, there is ways to add [images](https://tutorialedge.net/golang/hugo/hugo-adding-images-to-posts/) to the site just like any other.

### Using CSS and HTML to Style a Page

CSS and HTML still play their parts on a site like this. 

There are several guids that explain how to manipulate the CSS to style your pages better than I could explain them:

- [Add Custom CSS Or Javascript To Your Hugo Site](https://www.banjocode.com/post/hugo/custom-css/)

- [Write Custom CSS to Style the site](https://hugo-mini-course.netlify.app/sections/styling/custom/)

- [Editing a themes CSS](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/where-do-i-edit-a-themes-css/18551)
